 # Svelexpress

#### Boilerplate project for developing svelte and express, without running them on seperate ports.

There are 2 Main folders which only needs to be interfered with.  
**client** - This folder contains svelte default file  
**server** - this folder contains a server.js file and api folder.  
  
That's all about it.You can just go through code to understand further.
